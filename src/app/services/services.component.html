    <p>The new Http Client is a upgraded version of the old Http Module. Here are some of the distinct advantages of using the
       new Http Client Module :-</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Typed, synchronous response body access, including support for JSON body types</p></li>
        <li><p>JSON is an assumed default and no longer needs to be explicitly parsed</p></li>
        <li><p>Interceptors allow middleware logic to be inserted into the pipeline</p></li>
        <li><p>Immutable request/response objects</p></li>
        <li><p>Progress events for both request upload and response download</p></li>
        <li><p>Post-request verification & flush based testing framework</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>In this Get call see what all the new features have been added</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>We can now give the type of the call in the get which leads to Type safety</p></li>
        <li><p>No more <code>.json()</code>. By default it is considered json</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>All the other Api calls will mimic the same Interface and call it from a Angular Service .</p>

      <p>Notice that we are building the HTTPParams object by chaining successive set() methods. This is because HTTPParams is immutable, and its API methods do not cause object mutation.
          Instead, a call to set will return a new HttpParams object containing the new value properties. So this means that the following will NOT work:</p>

      <p>If we try to populate our parameters like this, we will not have the expected result. Instead, we would have an empty HTTPParams object, and the two calls to set would have add no effect.</p>

    <p>Tapping into each observable using pipes in Http Services
      In general, an Observable can return multiple values over time. 
      An Observable from HttpClient always emits a single value and then completes, never to emit again. 
      To catch errors, you <code>pipe</code> the observable result from <code>http.get()</code> through an RxJS <code>catchError()</code> operator.
      The general catch should be applicable to all the other methods in the service

      <p class="bigger">Http Interceptors</p>
      <p>A new feature available in the new HTTP client is HTTP Interceptors. An HTTP Interceptor allows us to add some generic functionality to all our HTTP requests in only one place.
        Interceptors are ideal for cross-cutting concerns like for example adding an authentication token header transparently to all the requests made by the HTTP client.

      <ul>
        <li><p>The <code>next.handle</code> method needs to be called to continue the interceptor chain, and for the HTTP request to be made</p></li>
        <li><p>The <code>next.handle</code> method returns an observable, and this is then returned by the intercept method
            this API is similar to middleware libraries such as express</p></li>
        <li><p>The request object is immutable, so if we want to modify the request for example to add a header, we need to clone it</p></li>
        <li><p>The headers object is also immutable, so as we saw before we need to clone it and create a modified copy of it, for example using <code>(headers.set())</code></p></li>
        <li><p>The cloned request will now have the new HTTP header X-CustomAuthHeader
            The cloned and modified HTTP request is then returned to the middleware chain, and the resulting HTTP call will have the new header included</p></li>

      <p>To Look at all the <code>gists</code> used in the code check this link there are some extra gists too of http client <a href="https://gist.github.com/rahulrsingh09/271aaff4cb134685ed7a62197670938c">gists</a>.</p>
      <p> I have also implemented these http methods but its always a good practise to make use of services instead of making http calls
        in the component itself . I have made a service and called these methods in the ServicesComponent. Check the repository for the code link in the Header .</p>
